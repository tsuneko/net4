# net4
.NET Framework 4.0 RPM/WPM bindings for Love2D/LuaJIT. This was made specifically to read and write to application memory for windows for my own personal debugging purposes (I wanted Love2D for a GUI). This isn't a full library, I only have wrapped functions which I needed and exposed some light userdata. You need a decent understanding of the lua-c library to use it properly.
